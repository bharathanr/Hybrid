Hybrid Renderer
----------------
Goal: To create a complex scene using OGRE and add a ray traced object to it.

Features
---------
1. Visualise a scene and edit it.
2. View the rasterised part of the scene.
3. View the ray traced object alone.
4. View the Hybrid scene.

Note: You should allow viewing 3 and 4 as the scene is built.

Design Goals
-------------
1. Cross platform. 
2. Offline rendering
   * Allow saving images in the PNG format.
   * Allow visualisation through the raster engine.  
3. Loose coupling of components.
   * Reusable, modular ray tracer
     - Allow maximum reuse for upgrade to any other kind of ray tracer than the one implemented.
     - Modularity is key for testing with different acceleration structures like a BVH and a 
       K-D tree
   * Independant Application framework.
     - Application base class 
     - Flexible window creation and management
     - StateManager i/f
     - RasterEngine i/f
     - Clean i/f to the ray tracer to allow changes
4. Allow the use of graphics engines other than OGRE.
5. Allow N threads for the ray tracer + one thread for the rasteriser.
6. Allow for some way to update the ray tracer's scene graph : Needs thought.
7. Allow for importing different formats. ??
