This is a response to a test set by Professor Benjamin C. Lok at the University
of Florida. I am an Indian and have no official affiliation with him. This work
is being done purely out of my own interest. Professor Lok has been very kind 
in suggestig that I do this project.

Language: C++
Libraries: OGRE, OIS

This project is one possible hybrid implementation of  ratirisation and 
ray tracing. I am making the code public under XXX. I hope someone 
finds it useful.
